        <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</h1>

        <p>
            who would've thought that i would write a love letter for someone,
            when i would usually do it for someone else's lover, now i am making
            one for my own? i have never felt this much pressure to write one for
            you, i'd brag to others that i can write a letter within few minutes
            but this one took few days to finish.
        </p>

        <p>
            love has never been in my mind ever since it has tore my heart a lot
            of times, and i have given up the thought of falling in love again.
            only fools would fall in love is what i always say to myself.
            who would've thought that i would be pointing at my own face telling
            i'm a fool? it's ironic that have said that i have kicked out love
            from my life, that i don't have anything to do with it but look at me
            now? giggling, blushing, and smiling over a guy that i thought would
            only be a temporary feeling. fourth of november was the first day we
            talked, who would've thought i'd celebrated fourteen of february with
            you?
        </p>

        <p>
            ever since you came into my life, everything felt so easy and light.
            it felt like a huge burden on my shoulder was lifted up. i never
            expected that i would like you this much, when i was telling myself
            that i would only see you as a friend. you have made me realized that
            i was still capable of loving someone, and i was loved by someone
            like you.
        </p>

        <p>
            i am still learning every day, and i am changing too, well not only
            for me but for the both of us. we both have our shortcomings, but i
            pray that we can still make it work. i'm still trying to understand
            you, and adjusting. please be patient with me too.
        </p>

        <p>
            i once prayed to God to give me a love that only i can see on movies,
            it seemed really impossible but i really prayed for it then it gave
            me you. i am still guarding my heart though, am i ready to gamble
            everything in this love? will you be an answered prayers, or lesson
            learnt? all i pray for now is for it to be you for a lifetime,
            because if it's not you then i don't want to believe in love anymore.
            even though we are far from each other, i only pray for that our love
            will always stay. I am choosing you, every day, and i am choosing us
            always and forever.
        </p>
